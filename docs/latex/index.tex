{\bfseries Wa}rwick {\bfseries S}mooth Particle {\bfseries H}ydrodynamics ({\bfseries Wa\+SH}) is a Domain Specific Language used for developing High Performance S\+PH simulations with built-\/in parallelisation using Open\+MP and C\+U\+DA.

This documentation has an \href{md_markdown_example_usecase.html}{\tt {\bfseries Introductory Simulation}} to show you how to use the Wa\+SH A\+PI to write a fully-\/functional S\+PH simulation.

Before that, you must make sure all the required libraries and dependencies are installed. Just follow the \href{md_markdown_installation.html}{\tt {\bfseries Installation Steps}} here.
