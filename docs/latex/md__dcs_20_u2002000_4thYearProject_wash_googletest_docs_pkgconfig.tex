Google\+Test comes with pkg-\/config files that can be used to determine all necessary flags for compiling and linking to Google\+Test (and Google\+Mock). Pkg-\/config is a standardised plain-\/text format containing


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the includedir (-\/I) path
\item necessary macro (-\/D) definitions
\item further required flags (-\/pthread)
\item the library (-\/L) path
\item the library (-\/l) to link to
\end{DoxyItemize}

All current build systems support pkg-\/config in one way or another. For all examples here we assume you want to compile the sample {\ttfamily samples/sample3\+\_\+unittest.\+cc}.

\subsubsection*{C\+Make}

Using {\ttfamily pkg-\/config} in C\+Make is fairly easy\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
find\_package(PkgConfig)
pkg\_search\_module(GTEST REQUIRED gtest\_main)

add\_executable(testapp)
target\_sources(testapp PRIVATE samples/sample3\_unittest.cc)
target\_link\_libraries(testapp PRIVATE $\{GTEST\_LDFLAGS\})
target\_compile\_options(testapp PRIVATE $\{GTEST\_CFLAGS\})

enable\_testing()
add\_test(first\_and\_only\_test testapp)
\end{DoxyCode}


It is generally recommended that you use {\ttfamily target\+\_\+compile\+\_\+options} + {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+C\+F\+L\+A\+GS} over {\ttfamily target\+\_\+include\+\_\+directories} + {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+I\+N\+C\+L\+U\+D\+E\+\_\+\+D\+I\+RS} as the former includes not just -\/I flags (Google\+Test might require a macro indicating to internal headers that all libraries have been compiled with threading enabled. In addition, Google\+Test might also require {\ttfamily -\/pthread} in the compiling step, and as such splitting the pkg-\/config {\ttfamily Cflags} variable into include dirs and macros for {\ttfamily target\+\_\+compile\+\_\+definitions()} might still miss this). The same recommendation goes for using {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+L\+D\+F\+L\+A\+GS} over the more commonplace {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+R\+I\+ES}, which happens to discard {\ttfamily -\/L} flags and {\ttfamily -\/pthread}.

\subsubsection*{Help! pkg-\/config can\textquotesingle{}t find Google\+Test!}

Let\textquotesingle{}s say you have a {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} along the lines of the one in this tutorial and you try to run {\ttfamily cmake}. It is very possible that you get a failure along the lines of\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
-- Checking for one of the modules 'gtest\_main'
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:640 (message):
  None of the required 'gtest\_main' found
\end{DoxyCode}


These failures are common if you installed Google\+Test yourself and have not sourced it from a distro or other package manager. If so, you need to tell pkg-\/config where it can find the {\ttfamily .pc} files containing the information. Say you installed Google\+Test to {\ttfamily /usr/local}, then it might be that the {\ttfamily .pc} files are installed under {\ttfamily /usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig}. If you set


\begin{DoxyCode}
export PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig
\end{DoxyCode}


pkg-\/config will also try to look in {\ttfamily P\+K\+G\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+F\+I\+G\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH} to find {\ttfamily gtest\+\_\+main.\+pc}.

\subsubsection*{Using pkg-\/config in a cross-\/compilation setting}

Pkg-\/config can be used in a cross-\/compilation setting too. To do this, let\textquotesingle{}s assume the final prefix of the cross-\/compiled installation will be {\ttfamily /usr}, and your sysroot is {\ttfamily /home/\+M\+Y\+U\+S\+E\+R/sysroot}. Configure and install G\+Test using


\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir build && cmake -DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=/usr ..
\end{DoxyCode}


Install into the sysroot using {\ttfamily D\+E\+S\+T\+D\+IR}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
make -j install DESTDIR=/home/MYUSER/sysroot
\end{DoxyCode}


Before we continue, it is recommended to {\bfseries always} define the following two variables for pkg-\/config in a cross-\/compilation setting\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
export PKG\_CONFIG\_ALLOW\_SYSTEM\_CFLAGS=yes
export PKG\_CONFIG\_ALLOW\_SYSTEM\_LIBS=yes
\end{DoxyCode}


otherwise {\ttfamily pkg-\/config} will filter {\ttfamily -\/I} and {\ttfamily -\/L} flags against standard prefixes such as {\ttfamily /usr} (see \href{https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28264#c3}{\tt https\+://bugs.\+freedesktop.\+org/show\+\_\+bug.\+cgi?id=28264\#c3} for reasons why this stripping needs to occur usually).

If you look at the generated pkg-\/config file, it will look something like


\begin{DoxyCode}
libdir=/usr/lib64
includedir=/usr/include

Name: gtest
Description: GoogleTest (without main() function)
Version: 1.11.0
URL: https://github.com/google/googletest
Libs: -L$\{libdir\} -lgtest -lpthread
Cflags: -I$\{includedir\} -DGTEST\_HAS\_PTHREAD=1 -lpthread
\end{DoxyCode}


Notice that the sysroot is not included in {\ttfamily libdir} and {\ttfamily includedir}! If you try to run {\ttfamily pkg-\/config} with the correct {\ttfamily P\+K\+G\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+F\+I\+G\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+D\+IR=/home/\+M\+Y\+U\+S\+E\+R/sysroot/usr/lib64/pkgconfig} against this {\ttfamily .pc} file, you will get


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ pkg-config --cflags gtest
-DGTEST\_HAS\_PTHREAD=1 -lpthread -I/usr/include
$ pkg-config --libs gtest
-L/usr/lib64 -lgtest -lpthread
\end{DoxyCode}


which is obviously wrong and points to the {\ttfamily C\+B\+U\+I\+LD} and not {\ttfamily C\+H\+O\+ST} root. In order to use this in a cross-\/compilation setting, we need to tell pkg-\/config to inject the actual sysroot into {\ttfamily -\/I} and {\ttfamily -\/L} variables. Let us now tell pkg-\/config about the actual sysroot


\begin{DoxyCode}
export PKG\_CONFIG\_DIR=
export PKG\_CONFIG\_SYSROOT\_DIR=/home/MYUSER/sysroot
export PKG\_CONFIG\_LIBDIR=$\{PKG\_CONFIG\_SYSROOT\_DIR\}/usr/lib64/pkgconfig
\end{DoxyCode}


and running {\ttfamily pkg-\/config} again we get


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ pkg-config --cflags gtest
-DGTEST\_HAS\_PTHREAD=1 -lpthread -I/home/MYUSER/sysroot/usr/include
$ pkg-config --libs gtest
-L/home/MYUSER/sysroot/usr/lib64 -lgtest -lpthread
\end{DoxyCode}


which contains the correct sysroot now.
