Periodically we want to write out the simulation data to a file to inspect the intermediate values of particles \& properties. This can be achieved with a number of different backend technologies, H\+D\+F5 is one which supports parallelism with M\+PI.

As well, H\+D\+F5 formats can be read by visualisation software such as S\+P\+La\+SH which was built for visualising S\+PH simulation data.

We expect H\+D\+F5 to be built and present on the system for this use.
