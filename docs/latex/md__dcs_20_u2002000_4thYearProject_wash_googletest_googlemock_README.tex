\subsubsection*{Overview}

Google\textquotesingle{}s framework for writing and using C++ mock classes. It can help you derive better designs of your system and write better tests.

It is inspired by\+:

\item \href{https://easymock.org/}{\tt Easy\+Mock}
\item \href{https://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/}{\tt Hamcrest}
\end{DoxyItemize}

It is designed with C++\textquotesingle{}s specifics in mind.

g\+Mock\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Provides a declarative syntax for defining mocks.
\item Can define partial (hybrid) mocks, which are a cross of real and mock objects.
\item Handles functions of arbitrary types and overloaded functions.
\item Comes with a rich set of matchers for validating function arguments.
\item Uses an intuitive syntax for controlling the behavior of a mock.
\item Does automatic verification of expectations (no record-\/and-\/replay needed).
\item Allows arbitrary (partial) ordering constraints on function calls to be expressed.
\item Lets a user extend it by defining new matchers and actions.
\item Does not use exceptions.
\item Is easy to learn and use.
